1. Define Requirements & Architecture
Clarify Features:
Users add their website(s) via a dashboard.
Provide a script that users embed on their websites.
The script communicates with your backend to trigger crawling.
The system detects SEO issues (broken links, redirect links, page titles, meta descriptions).
Present issues to users in the dashboard with an option to “fix” them.
Outline Data Flow:
User logs in → adds website → receives a unique script → script sends requests to backend → backend crawls and detects issues → issues are stored and displayed → user triggers fixes → script updates the website’s HTML in real time.
Define Architecture:
Frontend (Next.js using the App Router) for the dashboard and API endpoints.
Backend API endpoints for crawling, issue management, and executing fixes.
Clerk for authentication.
MongoDB for persisting user data, website details, crawl results, and action logs.

2. Project Setup
Initialize the Project:
Start with your existing Next.js project.
Ensure you’re using the App Router architecture.
Organize Directory Structure:
Separate folders for pages, API routes, components, and utilities (e.g., crawling and SEO analysis logic).

3. Authentication with Clerk
Integrate Clerk:
Set up Clerk according to their documentation.
Configure authentication on protected routes (dashboard, API endpoints).
Test the login, signup, and session management flows.
User Management:
Link authenticated users to their websites and crawl data in MongoDB.

4. Database Setup with MongoDB
Connection & Schema Design:
Establish a connection to MongoDB using your preferred method (e.g., Mongoose or native driver).
Create schemas/collections for:
Users (storing user details and auth references)
Websites (each entry including the website URL, script identifier, and configuration)
SEO Issues (storing details about detected problems per website)
Actions/Logs (tracking fix requests and changes made)
Testing Database Operations:
Ensure that CRUD operations work correctly for each collection.

5. Website Management Dashboard
Website Addition:
Build a user interface where logged-in users can add a new website.
On submission, store the website details in MongoDB.
Script Generation:
Generate a unique script snippet for each website (using a unique identifier to tie the script to the website record).
Provide instructions for users to embed this script into their website.
Dashboard Overview:
Display added websites and status (e.g., last crawl, issues detected).

6. Script Implementation for Website Integration
Script Functionality:
Develop a lightweight script that users embed on their website.
The script should:
Communicate with your backend (e.g., via API calls) to signal the presence of the site.
Periodically or on-demand trigger a crawl by notifying the backend.
Listen for commands from the backend (e.g., “fix this issue”) and apply HTML changes.
Security Considerations:
Ensure that the script only performs safe modifications and can authenticate requests to prevent misuse.

7. Crawling and SEO Issue Detection
Crawling Logic:
Develop a backend process (or API endpoint) to crawl the website pages.
The crawler should:
Retrieve HTML content.
Parse the DOM to extract SEO-relevant elements (page title, meta description, link statuses).
Identify broken links and unwanted redirects.
Issue Detection:
Define rules/criteria for what constitutes an “issue” (e.g., missing or duplicate meta descriptions, broken links).
Store detected issues in the SEO Issues collection in MongoDB.

8. Presenting Issues in the Dashboard
UI for Issue Display:
Create dashboard views that list the detected issues for each website.
Include details such as affected URLs, current meta data, and the type of issue.
User Actions:
Provide actionable buttons or controls for users to “fix” an issue.
Ensure that the UI clearly explains what each fix will do before the user confirms.

9. Implementing the Fix Functionality
Fix Request Flow:
When a user selects to fix an issue, trigger an API call that:
Validates the request.
Communicates with the embedded script on the user’s website.
Live HTML Updates:
The script, upon receiving a fix command from the backend, updates the HTML elements (e.g., updating page title, meta description, or link attributes).
Confirmation & Logging:
Confirm that the changes were applied (either by a callback from the script or a subsequent crawl).
Log the change in the Actions/Logs collection.

10. API Endpoints with Next.js App Router
Create Secure Endpoints:
Build API routes for:
Website management (adding, listing websites)
Triggering crawls and receiving crawl data
Submitting fix commands
Ensure that these endpoints use Clerk middleware or similar mechanisms for authentication and authorization.
Data Validation & Error Handling:
Implement robust error handling and data validation to ensure the endpoints are secure and reliable.

11. UI/UX and Frontend Considerations
User Flow:
Design a simple and intuitive flow: login → add website → embed script → view crawl results → fix issues.
Dashboard Design:
Use clear visual cues and real-time status updates to inform users about website health and recent changes.
Feedback Mechanisms:
Provide notifications or visual confirmations when changes are applied successfully.

12. Testing and Quality Assurance
Unit & Integration Testing:
Test individual functions (e.g., crawling, issue detection) and ensure that API endpoints perform as expected.
End-to-End Testing:
Simulate the complete user flow, from adding a website to applying fixes via the embedded script.
Security Testing:
Ensure that authentication is robust and that unauthorized actions cannot be performed.
Performance Testing:
Evaluate the crawl and fix functionalities, especially on larger websites, to ensure the system scales appropriately.

13. Deployment & Monitoring
Deployment Preparation:
Prepare your production environment (Next.js hosting, MongoDB deployment, etc.).
Ensure all environment variables (Clerk keys, MongoDB connection strings) are correctly set.
Monitor and Log:
Set up monitoring for server performance, errors, and user activity.
Use logs to track crawl operations, fix commands, and any potential issues.
User Support & Iteration:
After deployment, gather user feedback and iterate on both functionality and performance improvements.
